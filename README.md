# Project-1
Project 1 was my first collaborative project with Sharyn Finney and James Burruss. 
We had built a Learning to Code Website.
I was head of the project with the initial idea and help both front end and backend. 
Sharyn primary focus was the back end.
And James primary focus was the front end
It took us 3 weeks to build this website.
